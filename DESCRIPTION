Description: This package extends optimal matching functionality to cases where enrollment in the treatment 
             is rolling. As such, this package only slightly modifies the {optmatch} package and acknowledges
             a heavy debt to its authors: Ben B. Hansen, Mark Fredrickson, Josh Buckner, Josh Errickson, Adam Rauh, 
             and Peter Solenberger.  Like {optmatch}, GroupMatch uses the RELAX-IV minimum cost flow solver due 
             to Dimitri P. Bertsekas and Paul  Tseng to solve a representation of the matching problem as a network flow.
             It is possible to combine this representation of the matching problem with standard constraints, such
             as calipers or exact-matching, to improve balance or create a stratified matching problem.
